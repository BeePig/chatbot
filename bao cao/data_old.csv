I also purchased the Learn to Read Activity Book (which I prefer). It does contain a lot of sight words, so if you\u2019re looking more for cat, sat, rat, bat types of words, then this is not the book for you. It says sight words and phonics activity workbook, so I was expecting more words my child could pronounce phonetically, rather than most of it being aight words. This book has the same activities for each word (a, all, am, and, are, at, be, big, by, can, come, do, for, go, has, have, he, here, I, in, is, it, jump, like, little, look, me, my, nice, no, not, one, our, out, play, run, said, see, she, the, to, up, was, we, went, what, where, with, yes, you). The child first traces the word and says it aloud. Then the child writes the word, and then completes a sentence with the word. This is followed by grabbing a crayon and coloring the boxes with the word. Lastly the child writes a sentence using the word, and draws a picture. Since my child is a beginning reader, she doesn\u2019t have the word knowledge yet for writing sentences. I was expecting this book to build on concepts. In terms of the sentences the child completes, I would have preferred simple sentences we could sound out together, so that she could feel like she was learning to read."", ""review_title"": ""Mostly sight words; does not build on concepts; no variation in activities"", ""review_url"": ""https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2763HF4JQVOMT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1948209543"", ""reviewed_date"": ""June 11, 2019"", ""reviewed_product_varient"": ""Format: Paperback""}, {""author_name"": ""David Basken"", ""author_profile"": ""https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AGLSQ5MKUWVPULYU6ZUGJR57UAKA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8"", ""badge"": ""Verified Purchase"", ""rating"": ""5.0"", ""review_text"": ""We've been trying to teach our daughter how to read but it had been a slow process and we found this on Amazon.

I think she likes the fact that she gets to write sentences using the words and then draw the picture at the end.

One thing they say they don't like so much about parents practicing writing letters before they learn them in school is that kids practice with bad habits, and then it takes several years for the teachers and parents to train those sloppy cute 3 year old habits out of the student. This book is designed well. I cut the spine off and put each page in a protective sheet so we could use dry erase marker, but I haven't used it because the letters go above and below the lines. Whoever made this did a super lazy job of making it a lined traceable pattern. I can do my best to help my kid hold their pencil right, follow the proper formation of the letter, but it's printed on the page way off the lines... and if my kid thinks that's OK to not stay in the dotted proportion lines... they aren't going well when it's hand writing homework time..."", ""review_title"": ""Not accurate letter positioning"", ""review_url"": ""https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NA50TOJ7IAY3/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1948209152"", ""reviewed_date"": ""July 05, 2019"", ""reviewed_product_varient"": ""Format: Paperback""}, {""author_name"": ""J.E.T.O."", ""author_profile"": ""https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHXLRNRKLTLEDN36BXH77WG67EIA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8"", ""badge"": ""Verified Purchase"", ""rating"": ""2.0"", ""review_text"": ""I regret not purchasing the number tracing book from a different brand, here's how this book didn't meet my expectations: I was looking for a book that would provide a lot of tracing practice for a preschooler on paper. This book had only a few examples to trace for each number despite despite the book being called a tracing book and after that it was all just empty space for writing, also their wasn't even enough space to practice the writing. If you do buy this it would be best to buy some plastic covers or laminate so you can erase and practice some more which in my opinion defeats the purpose because I wanted a work book with plenty of paper practice space so we don't have to worry about laminating pages.. The cover has a weird oily rubbery texture to it, I did not like this. I expected the book to be thicker since it's a practice book.

What I liked about this one is that there are arrows on each number instructing kids where to start with their writing utensil and what path to take to trace the number. For example, the number one is a straight line drawn from top to bottom in one stroke. The number four starts in the upper left-hand corner, comes down and then right. After the angle is drawn, then you draw a straight line from top to bottom on the right-hand side. I realize my kids will mostly type in this life, but I still think that penmanship matters. I realized my mistake with my oldest, who developed odd writing habits because he drew letter and number parts in the wrong order. Like the number four is a line from top to bottom and then the angle. If you\u2019re thinking - um, who cares?? I do, because he\u2019s writing from left to right but forming numbers and letters from right to left and this makes his writing illegible and also frustrating for him.

Author, Elizabeth Wetmore, has penned some stunning, pastoral prose in her first novel, \u201cValentine\u201d. You\u2019ll be able to see, hear, smell, taste, and FEEL all that is West Texas and the oilfields in the 1970\u2019s. It was booming as far as oil was concerned but archaic in its evolution for women and minorities. The story is told in revolving POV\u2019s between the main female characters. Wetmore begins the story directly after the rape of 14 year old Gloria/Glory and then proceeds to fill in the gaps and characters by allowing them to speak and narrate individual chapters. There\u2019s much more narrative than dialogue which is unusual in contemporary fiction. It reminds me of the writings of authors like Larry McMurtry or older Barbara Kingsolver (\u201cBeanTree Wars\u201d) and even Pat Conroy. She\u2019s going to be on my watch list. Women in this story are strong, courageous, flawed and resilient. Most of the men are portrayed in a negative or absent light. There are a few that are \u201cok\u201d but by and far, the testosterone fails in this one. The bad guys are heinous and the guys that are supposed to be good aren\u2019t so great. It\u2019s a tough story for the males of our species. For characterizations, the author has done a spectacular job. Altho\u2019 the topic of the book is rape, the sexual content of the book is handled well. There\u2019s nothing that\u2019s overly descriptive sexually nor is there any violent excess. I\u2019d rate both of these 3.5/10 or PG-13. There are a few expletives, including f-bombs, but they are minimal and used in an appropriate literary manner - not flagrant display, shock value or lazy writing. These uses are emotional utterances by accurately motivated characters; 2/10 \u201cValentine\u201d is a rare book of exceptional quality that revisits a time gone bye with unfortunate events that continue to plague our contemporary society.

Oil is spewing from so many oil fields that it is unbelievable. This drought-ridden desert of a place is a misbegotten city with not much going for it. On February 15, 1976, one of the oil workers picks up 14 year old Gloria Ramirez at a drive through hamburger joint and takes her to a deserted oil rig where he beats and rapes her repeatedly. \""If the young roughneck hadn't passed out before he sobered up enough to find his gun or get his hands around her throat, she would already be dead\"". Gloria, who will never use her given name from this day, manages to walk/crawl through the desert, cactus, drought ridden terrain until she gets to a farm house where a pregnant Mary Rose opens the door and lets Glory inside. This novel is brilliant. Each sentence contains a world. There are no rabbit trails and no fillers. This is a book of essence, poetic and literary, yet spot on with its narrative, storytelling and characterization. The novel is told primarily through four voices. Mary Rose is pregnant and already has one daughter. The impact of letting Glory into her home and believing the story of what happened to her will change her life forever. Debra Ann is a precocious child who has her ear to the ground and knows the ups and downs of Odessa. Her mother has run off and in many ways she is a feral child, but one with spunk, empathy, and intelligence to spare. Corrine is a curmudgeonly widow who is about as close to being a misanthrope as one can get. Sometimes she will will let Debra Ann get to her but mostly she drinks to stave off her grief and anger at the world. Gloria has decided that she will forevermore be called Glory, that she must leave Odessa in order to survive. This will have ramifications she never dreamed of. As many of the women in the United States glory in their newfound freedom by burning their bras, joining NOW, and reading Ms. Magazine, this is not what it's like in Odessa. Here the women are second class citizens, bred to obey their husbands, go to church, not make waves, and raise their children. If they get out of line, they are called out or even shunned. Odessa is not on the mailing list for a feminist wake-up call. Additionally, being hispanic in Odessa is a triple whammy. The racism is thick and evil like just-fried molasses on your tongue, burning up those who question the righteousness of this hate. As the four women's lives intersect in many ways, a narrative is created that will shake the reader's core. If this book was an earthquake, its magnitude will shake the book right out of your hands and into the next world. Do I believe that this is Ms. Wetmore's first novel? Yes. Do I think it's miraculous? Also, yes. A book like this comes around just a few times in your lifetime, if you're lucky.

I would recommend that any parents looking at this also buy a small pack of crayons at the same time because a good number of the exercises are coloring or tracing. The exercises are all progressive, building up as you advance through the book. I also really like how they are stand alone exercises confined to a single page, but generally grouped over about 3 pages (for example, find the letter \""C\"" and trace the letter \""C\"" and circle all these things that begin with the letter \""C\"" over the course of a few pages). This makes it very simple for us to work on a single letter in about 10 minutes, which is all his attention span can really firmly hold most nights.

Which was touted as telling the Love Story of Glennon and Abby. First, I am more than half way through this book, and their love story has only been touched upon, very briefly. So that is disappointing. But what really irks me is Glennon's changing narrative. And I understand that Glennon herself has changed a lot in the last decade. That she is evolving. But there were many people who Loved her previous books, who bought in to the message she was selling then. Who felt that those books and words spoke to them on a personal level. And now Glennon totally dismisses those works.

By page 16, I\u2019d already sobbed, laughed, sobbed, reconsidered who I am, how I live my life, and what I\u2019m doing next, and cried again. So much fire lit. This is a masterpiece. Thank the universe (and Glennon) it published now. Lord knows we need this now. It is already one of my top favorite books ever, and I read a lot. Like, a LOT. She talks about learning to access her own inner Knowing, which I had experienced as a miracle a few times in my life before I learned about this from the Guides in one of my other top books, I Am the Word by Paul Selig (and his other books). But this time I got a deeper, more practical grasp and inspiration around how and why to access that deeper knowing every day. She\u2019s right that it only ever tells you just the next step... Kyle Cease talks about that exactly the same way, too. I\u2019m also feeling a revolution inside that I was already opening up to take full force... including the revolutionary wild act of feeling it all. Everything. FEELING pain, letting it burn, guide. She says, \u201cI will continue to become only if I resist extinguishing myself a million times a day. If I can sit in the fire of my own feelings, I will keep becoming.\u201c By page 89, it is 3:41 am, and with my two small children asleep near my bed, I quietly sobbed and sobbed and sobbed, as my heart broke open. As I FELT. I\u2019ve barely cried in years. In decades. I\u2019m usually just trying to disconnect and numb feelings enough to keep going, to fit in, to stay the course, everything is fine. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m not fine. Our world is no longer fine. p115: my husband called me on video chat (we\u2019re thousands of miles apart right now) and he said, \u201cWhoa, you look different. You\u2019re glowing.\u201d Fire. Burning. Feeling. p133: Turns out cracking open and feeling all the feelings isn\u2019t just pain. Deep, body shaking joy came to our house today. Car, actually. After a difficult to describe very intense session of 5 people all air-planing our take-out lasagna bites to each other in our parked car and absolutely laughing out assess off this afternoon, my six year old says to me tonight right before bed, \u201cIt was so, so nice to hear Mama laughing. I\u2019d say it is better than getting a toy.\u201d P... somewhere after p 200 some major personal shifts and awakenings occurred... too personal to convey at this time. P324 I\u2019ve been running from my mother since I left for college. Really since I got a car in high school, and before that when I fell in love with my high school freshman boyfriend, who was also my best friend. I escaped into the safe shelter of his love and caring, laughter and companionship. And now, at 37 years old, it\u2019s time to stop. Because of this book. I can stop, be with it, with her. To let it burn. To face the pain, the triggers, and let the fire engulf me and burn away what was never real. To tell the truth, and face my mother with an open heart. I just moved in with my mom last night. I\u2019m literally quarantined in small house with just the two of us and my two small boys (6 and 3). For the first time in my whole life, I am not afraid. Thank you Glennon. My God... thank you. I\u2019m now going to click the \u201cbeginning\u201d button in my kindle and read it all again. I\u2019m a little nervous and excited... the wild way my life is cracking open... I have no idea how, maybe I was really ready... this book has immediately and shockingly changed everything, and given me the map for change with truth, freedom and grace. With love. Yes to the heartbreak. Yes to the pain. Yes to love. Yes to myself and my life untamed, in truth.

I can feel them like a vibration in my bones.

The basic and intended use is to follow a sequence of steps whereby you, part by part, draw the animal. My 9 year old grandson has no problem doing it this way. While fun, it's a very educational process in which they break up an item into its component parts and follow a sequence or steps which must be followed in order and with attention to detail. If they should learn to approach other material in this way it will do good for their problem-solving abilities in other disciplines. My 5-year old granddaughter has difficulty actually drawing each part free-form. If you are too far off in the initial steps, there is no way that you will end up with a satisfactory finished product. So we are approaching it as tracing exercises. She first traces the first form, then I move the paper and position it above step 2 (I have to hold it in place), she then traces the next step, and so on until the animal is finished. It works perfectly. My grandson also likes this approach, although he moves and holds the tracing paper in place himself. I like for them to do these small-muscle exercises. They don't do a great deal of penmanship at school and with so much of their work done on computers or tablets, I despair that they will ever have legible handwriting or hand skills that require precision. They absolutely hate more obviously academic exercises, such as penmanship, but this is an activity they enjoy from beginning to end and I'm happy that, through devious trickery, I'm achieving my goal."", ""review_title"": ""Fun--but with serious educational benefits."", ""review_url"": ""https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3V6IQ76GR078P/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1842297406"", ""reviewed_date"": ""August 05, 2018"", ""reviewed_product_varient"": ""Format: Paperback""}, {""author_name"": ""Christi"", ""author_profile"": ""https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AFZT5HDS5OIF5OTKRP7RDZXKHYWA/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_gw_tr?ie=UTF8"", ""badge"": ""Verified Purchase"", ""rating"": ""5.0"", ""review_text"": ""My 9 year old really enjoys drawing and this really helps her learn to draw!

I retorqued they, parents, could help them and despite their supposedly unability to draw (according to them), this book was a great opportunity to spend time all together drawing and learning having fun: what a luxury! In fact, one might have talent to be able to draw, but he/she still needs to practice hours to be good. I mean that nothing falls from the sky by miracle. This book about how to draw animals and it decomposes step by step the process of drawing. It is so easy and so well done! In our dimension all shapes are circles, squares, triangles...to start with. This book is a precious guide for kids or whoever, whatever the age is. Sure one will not be a Da Vinci tomorrow, as it is simplified drawings, but away from technology one will have learned something having so much fun.

The day it arrived in the mail, my 12 year old daughter was having a hysterical fit over the screen of her iPhone not working correctly (which was solved by restarting her phone - but not until she sobbed hysterically about her life being over for 30 minutes). I looked at her face, I looked at the book, I looked at her face again, I looked at the book again. And all was right with the world. I don't have enough words in my vocabulary to describe how awesome the drawings are in this book. Sometimes I want something intricate to focus on while the world around me is being annoying. Sometimes I want something quick and easy. And some days I just want to color in pictures with silly words. This book allows me to do all of the above. I can\u2019t even begin to pick a favorite picture. There are so many incredible choices. They work well with pens and pencils. The pictures are cheeky and fun.

I mostly choose coloring books with animal designs, mandalas, and various patterns but I needed something to satisfy my sarcastic side. Once I found this book, I immediately ordered it because many reviewers claimed it was stress-relieving AND hilarious, which was exactly what I needed! When I started coloring in this book, I couldn't believe how funny and sarcastic it is! Seriously, you can't own this book and not laugh while coloring in it. The saying goes, \""Laughter is the best medicine\"" and this book is a very inexpensive and enjoyable way to relax. The book measures 8 1/2 inches by 11 inches so the pages are regular printer paper size. There are two color test pages at the front of the book so you can test out your colored pencils or gel pens before you start coloring. There are 21 designs in all, each on their own separate page so you could tear them out to hang up, share with a friend, etc. Some are printed portrait whereas others are printed landscape. Some designs have swear words in them while others have lots of sarcasm and funny pictures to accompany them! There are a couple designs that are somewhat intricate but most of them should be fairly easy to color with colored pencils and gel pens. The paper used is somewhat thinner than other books I have but I just put some paper underneath the page so the gel pens don't bleed through. This is a great book for anyone who has a sarcastic side and loves to color!

Jonathan Karl has been covering DJT for a long time; since MJ married Lisa Marie! He was a novice reporter and Trump the gossiping real estate mogul. This is the jumping off point for \u201cFront Row at the Trump Show\u201d. Karl has a writing style that\u2019s conversational and inclusive. This is easy reading. He gives insights to many of the events we\u2019ve heard about, not just that they happened, but why or how and his take on the motivations; interesting, but most decidedly not always agreed with. The text is peppered with parts of conversations and texts; seeing them in aggregate, in black & white was giant cauldron of emotions. I\u2019m not sure how I feel about this at all. Detailing Trump\u2019s relationship to the media, both good and bad and how this is part, a BIG PART, of \u201chis show\u201d as president, is the real meat and bones of this volume.

Many educated people think that these daily briefings should not be shown at all because of the dangerous and inaccurate information being broadcast, some of which have caused deaths of U.S. citizens.

My vantage point is unique\u2014and not just because of where I sit at presidential press conferences. I\u2019ve known Donald Trump longer than almost all of his top advisors and the reporters who cover him. \u2026 In writing this book, I mined my notebooks, my journals, and my experience to tell a story that is impossible to convey in the crush of day-to-day reporting on the Trump White House: what it is really like to do this job and interact with this president. I have also gone back to interview the key players\u2026 I call it the Trump Show because that is the way President Trump sees it. He tracks the critics but craves their approval. WHERE THIS BOOK STANDS POLITICALLY: On the one hand, this book is pretty balanced. The author attempts to enlighten readers about the reality of what he calls the Trump Show, and that involves exposing Trump\u2019s manipulations and intentional misstatements. On the other hand, the author seems to fawn over Trump quite a bit.

With that said we also have come across subjects that have not been age-appropriate and maybe not at all appropriate for certain households. There was a section about necromancy, ouija boards, haunted houses, palm reading, tarot cards, and the likes. There also have been other sections where we had to use the power of distraction or skim over some things for the kids.
